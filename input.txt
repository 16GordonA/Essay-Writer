In his sonnet 90, Shakespeare requests that the Fair Youth end his relationship with the Poet, and "hate [him]... if ever, now" (XC i), in order that he might contribute to the beginning of a cycle of bad fortune, rather than "drop in for an after-loss" (iv). 

This theme continues as the Poet mentions further "sorrow" and likens his experiences to a "windy night" (v,vii). Finally, Shakespeare concludes that, though a break-up with the Fair Youth would be "the very worst of fortune's might" (xii), it will alleviate the suffering caused by the Poet's other misfortunes. However, this romantic outlook on their love is tempered by the use of military language throughout the sonnet.
